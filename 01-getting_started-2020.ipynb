    "1. Click on the file to view it on Github. (It may show an error, but this is okay; what is important is to have access to the 'raw' file, not to be able to preview it in Github.)\n",

    "3. Depending on your system, the file either downloads directly or you see the raw computer code behind this. That's fine, just click on \"File/save as\" in your browser, or right-click.\n",
    "4. It is *very important* that you do *not* choose 'HTML', 'web page' or something similar in Save-as-dialogue. Choose \"All files (\\*.\\*)\" or similar as file type, and make sure that the filename ends in \".ipynb\".  Also try to do \"all files\" instead of a text file.  Know where it is that you save the file, of course, on your computer.  It's probably wisest to create one folder for our class and keep everything there.\n",

    "\n",
    "Colab will allow you to run things through the cloud.  You can interface directly with Github from there, and it seems to keep track of your files within your Colab space.  You can aslo save things to Google Drive from within Colab.  We'll talk more about the benefits & drawbacks of Colab and Anaconda in class during week 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Within the basic welcome Colaboratory screen, you can click on \"File - Open Notebook\"\n",
    "2. Then click over to the Github tab, and simply paste in our github page address: https://github.com/uvacw/datajournalism\n",
    "3. Within there the various notebooks will appear, including this one - click on it to open it within Colab and you're off to the races.\n",
    "4. BUT!  You need to make a copy of the notebook for yourself before you can edit it/play around.  So, do that first.  You should save in Drive, and then you'll re-access the notebook not by going to Github, but by going to the \"drive\" tab at the File - Open Notebook option.\n"

You can either leave the original name - pandas - (by just typing `import pandas`) or shorten that name so you don't have to type it again and again and again.  So one shorthand that is commonly used is `pd` for pandas.  Try importing it now with the following command.
